## Introduction
This repository is the official project page for (VL-CheckList). 
**VL-CheckList** is an explainable framework that comprehensively evaluates VLP models and facilitates deeper understanding.The current method to evaluate a VLP model is solely by comparing its fine-tuned downstream tasks performance, which has a number of limitations, such as poor interpretability, incomparable results and bias in data.


The core principle of VL-CheckList are: (1) evaluate a VLP model's fundamental capabilities instead of performance on applications (2) disentangle capabilities into relatively independent variables that are easier to analyze.

VL-CheckList evaluates VLP models from three aspects: Object, Attribute and Relationship. We provide the performance quantitative table and the radar chart based on the three aspects.

## How to Install VL-CheckList
You can install vl_checklist in your project and import vl_checklist and evaluate your models:
```
pip install vl_checklist
```
`vilt_test.py` is an example code to show how to import vl_checklist in your project. 

You need to copy `data/` and `corpus/` folders to the root of your project and prepare image datasets [Link](DATASETS.md). 

You can also clone this project add your model as follows. 
```
git clone https://github.com/om-ai-lab/VL-CheckList.git
```

## Detailed Guidelines How to Evaluate your Model
We include several representative example VLP models in the `example_models/` folder. 

**1.** Define a config file 
e.g. in [configs/sample.yaml](./configs/sample.yaml)
```
MAX_NUM: 2000
MODEL_NAME: "ViLT"
BATCH_SIZE: 4
TASK: "itc"
DATA:
  TYPES: ["Attribute/color"]
  TEST_DATA: ["vg","vaw"]   
OUTPUT: 
  DIR: "output/vilt"
```
**2.** Prepare Evaluation Data
We provide the initial curated jsons at `data/` and corresponding yamls at `vl_checklist/corpus`. You can need to download image dataset. You can find the instruction in detail [Link](DATASETS.md)

**3.** Load the model which contain `predict()` and Evaluate class as follows.  Please find an example model class [Link](./example_models/vilt/engine.py)

**4.** Run `start()` as follows

Here is an example code
```python
from example_models.vilt.engine import ViLT
from vl_checklist.evaluate import Evaluate

if __name__ == '__main__':
    model = ViLT('vilt_200k_mlm_itm.ckpt')
    vilt_eval = Evaluate(config="configs/sample.yaml", model=model)
    vilt_eval.start()
```    

**5.**  check the results in the OUTDIR DIR you defined the yaml file
You can check the output format [LINK](OUTPUT.md)

## Download Pretrained Weights
We include examples models at `example_models/`. You can download the pretrained weights at `resources/` folder to test our example models:

## Demo
We present the demo in huggingface space, you can try it here: [Demo link](https://huggingface.co/spaces/omlab/VL_checklist_demo)  
In this demo, you can change the object and attribute of object in the text prompt. You can also change the size and location of the object.
